# config-public

An effort to automate the process of setting up software and configurations on new computers - I'm publishing lists of all the important software and extensions I have on my devices, with other configuration files and setup scripts to come soon.



Some of the *absolute essentials*:

- **Browser**: Firefox
- **Mail client**: Thunderbird/Proprietary
- **Password manager**: Bitwarden
- **Clipboard history**: CopyQ
- **Chat**: Telegram
- **Screen recorder**: Peek/Proprietary
- **Package manager**: Homebrew, Chocolatey, Flatpak, etc.
- **Container/virtualization runtime**: Docker
- **Shell**: zsh (with oh-my-zsh and powerlevel10k) or WSL

- **Command-line utilities**: `git`, `git-lfs`, `gh`, `nvim`, `nvm`, `pyenv`, `conda`, `fuck`, `openssh`, `curl`, `rsync`  (more to come)
